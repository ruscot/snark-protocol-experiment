\subsection{Lenstra}
\cite{lenstra_guide} from what I understand, they said that we can optimize calculations through our finite field by choosing a right basis. And they give a method to select this basis. I read this paper for a better understanding of \hyperref[sec:COCO]{COCO} where they cite this technique.
