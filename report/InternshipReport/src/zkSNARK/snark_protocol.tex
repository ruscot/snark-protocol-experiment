\section{Protocol}
Now we have an idea of what are SNARK and how they work, our aim is to use them to create a remote polynomial evaluation. Where the server give a proof of the correctness of the computation. For this we'll use the groth16 algorithm implement in libsnark. All our results will be on this github \href{https://github.com/ruscot/snark-protocol-experiment}{repository}. We'll detail the steps of the Groth16 algorithm to have a better understanding of it.

First we have to convert our polynomial into a \textbf{rank 1 constraint system} (R1CS) which will be convert in a QAP and then we'll create our keys and start our protocol.
