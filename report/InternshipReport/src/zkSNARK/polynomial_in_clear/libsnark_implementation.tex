\subsection{Implementation in libsnark}
The major difference is in the setup of the verification key and the provable key, where we don't send the $A_i,B_i,C_i$ but the $A_i(s),B_i(s),C_i(s)$ with the R1CS constrainsts. And for the $\alpha, \beta, \sigma,\gamma$ they are already injected in the $A_i(s),B_i(s),C_i(s)$ above.
