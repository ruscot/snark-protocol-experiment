\subsection{Go back to our problem}
Now we have this protocol with zkSNARKs we want something quite similar. Back to a connexion client-server the problem is the following. A client want to evaluate a polynomial on a point, but he want that the server achieve this and gave him a proof of the correctness of the result.
\\We have something like this :
\\

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Client} & \textbf{Server} \TBstrut \\
  \hline
  P$\in F[X]$ a polynomial, we want to evaluate it on x $\in F$ & \TBstrut \\ 
  Send P and x to the server & \TBstrut \\
  \hline
     & Compute y = P(x) \TBstrut \\
     & Compute $\pi$ a proof that y is correct \TBstrut \\
     & Send $\pi$ and y to the client \TBstrut \\
    \hline
    With $\pi$ anyone can check that y is correct & \TBstrut \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\\
\\
In order to compute the proof of our computation we will use the SNARK protocol with QAP explained above.
