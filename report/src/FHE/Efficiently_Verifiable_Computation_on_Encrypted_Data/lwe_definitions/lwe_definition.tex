\subsection{LWE definition}
The learning with errors (\textbf{LWE}) problem was introduced by Regev \cite{LWE}. Defined as follow :\\
For security parameter $\lambda$ let n = n$(\lambda)$ be an integer dimension, let q = q$(\lambda)\geq 2$ be an integer and let $\chi$ = $\chi(\lambda)\geq 2$ be a distribution over $\mathbb{Z}$. The $LWE_{n,q,\chi}$ problem is to distinguish the following two distributions : 
\tabNormal In the first distribution, one samples ($a_i, b_i$) uniformly from $\mathbb{Z}_q^{n+1}$
\tabNormal In the second distribution one first draws $s \xleftarrow[]{\$}\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ uniformly and then samples $(a_i, b_i) \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{n+1}$ by sampling $a_i \xleftarrow[]{\$}\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ uniformly, $e_i \xleftarrow[]{\$}\chi$ and setting $b_i = \langle a,s \rangle + e_i$. The $LWE_{n,q,\chi}$ assumption is that the $LWE_{n,q,\chi}$ problem is infeasible.
