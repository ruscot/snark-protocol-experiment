\subsection{Snark protocol in ZK}
Now we have our protocol and the idea behind that. We want to remove the problem identify above. To perform this we'll use pairing with elliptic curves. $G1*G2 \rightarrow Gt$
\\Now let's define R like $R = \{p, G1, G2, Gt, e, g, h, l, A, B, C, Z\}$. With $(p, G1, G2, Gt, e, g, h)$ a bilinear map, with the following definition :

\textbf{Bilinear map} is defined by seven elements $(p, G_1, G_2, G_T, e, g, h)$ such that :
\tabNormal - $e:G_1*G_2\rightarrow G_T$
\tabNormal - $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_T$ are groups of prime order p
\tabNormal - g is a generator of $G_1$
\tabNormal - h is a generator of $G_2$
\tabNormal - e(g,h) is a generator of $G_T$
\tabNormal - $e(g^a, h^b) = e(g,h)^{ab}$ \\
\\For the same method Setup, Prove and Verify we just change the value of R and their output.

\subsubsection{Good point}
We have solved our problem \hyperref[sec:ProblemWithoutZK]{above}, with the encryption of $\alpha, \beta,\gamma,s$ the server can't compute W as before :
\\W=$\frac{UV-\alpha\beta-\sum_{i=0}^l(a_i(\beta A_i(s) + \alpha B_i(s) + C_i(s)))}{\delta}$
\\
or he has break the descrete logarithm problem in order to find s,$\beta, \alpha$ or $\gamma$.
