\subsection{R1CS from Polynomials}
The aim of this section is to give an explanation with an example of how to construct a \textbf{rank-1 constraint system} (R1CS) from a polynomial.
\\ Let's say we have the polynomial $x^3+x+5$ and we want to construct a corresponding R1CS.
\subsubsection{Flattening}
The first step is a "flattening" procedure. We transform our original polynomial to a succession  of equation of type $x=y(op)z$.
\\Going back to our example we have :
\\$sym_1 = x*x$ (1)
\\$y=sym_1 *x$ (2)
\\$sym_2 = y+x$ (3)
\\$out=sym_2+5$ (4)
\subsubsection{From flattening to R1CS}
Now we can convert our succession of operation into a R1CS. An R1CS is a sequence of groups of three vectors (a,b,c) and the solution to an R1CS is a vector s where $sa * sb - sc = 0$
\\The length of each vector is equal to the total number of variables in the system, including a dummy variable "one" which represent the number 1.
\\So in our case the vector length is 7 which is : 
\\"one", "x", "out", "sym\_1", "y", "sym\_2"
\\And the assignement of each variable will correspond to one operation. So for our first operation we have :
\\$a=[0,1,0,0,0,0]$
\\$b=[0,1,0,0,0,0]$
\\$c=[0,0,0,1,0,0]$
\\I just skip the second one which is approximately the same as the first one, and for the third to perform the addition we have this :
\\$a=[0,1,0,0,1,0]$
\\$b=[1,0,0,0,0,0]$
\\$c=[0,0,0,0,0,1]$
\\And the last :
\\$a=[5,0,0,0,0,1]$
\\$b=[1,0,0,0,0,0]$
\\$c=[0,0,1,0,0,0]$
\\So the complete R1CS is :
\\A
\\$[0,1,0,0,0,0]$
\\$[0,0,0,1,0,0]$
\\$[0,1,0,0,1,0]$
\\$[5,0,0,0,0,1]$
\\B
\\$[0,1,0,0,0,0]$
\\$[0,1,0,0,0,0]$
\\$[1,0,0,0,0,0]$
\\$[1,0,0,0,0,0]$
\\C
\\$[0,0,0,1,0,0]$
\\$[0,0,0,0,1,0]$
\\$[0,0,0,0,0,1]$
\\$[0,0,1,0,0,0]$
