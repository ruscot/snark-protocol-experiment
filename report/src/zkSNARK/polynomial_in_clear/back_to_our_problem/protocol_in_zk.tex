\subsubsection{Protocol in ZK}
Now we have our protocol let's imagine that the client don't wan't his polynomial P to be known by the server. So what we want is that the server don't learn anything about what he's currently computing.
\\ A possible solution is to cipher the polynomials P before creating the R1CS with paillier encryption. It's the aim of the third chapter in zkSNARK.
