The aim of the algorithm is to prove to a verifier that we know a secret without revealing it.
The algorithm will use a QAP to generate and check the proof that correspond to an equality of polynomials. This QAP need to be generated by yourself or a \textbf{trust party}. 

If we think about an architecture client-server where the server want to prove to the client that he knows a secret. 
Then the client (or a trust party of the client) will have to generate a QAP to check this secret and send some keys to the server. 
The server will create the proof and send it back to the client. 
To finish the client will check the proof and accept or reject it.
\\This algorithm is sound, complet and can be zero-knowledge (ZK). And we'll use it for our protocol.
