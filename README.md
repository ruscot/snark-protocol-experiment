# snark-protocol-experiment

The aim of this project is too give a simulation of a polynomial evaluation on a remote server with a proof of the result based on zkSNARK and FHE (fully homomorphic encryption). And compare different methods.

The library have the following directory structure:

* [__libsnark-experiment__](libsnark-experiment): protocol with libsnark on a clear polynomial
  <!-- * [__tests__](src/tests): collection of GTests -->
* [__report__](report): contain a report that explain the different methods.
